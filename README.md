# Nested Forms Example

**Resources:**
* [Railscast Episode 196](http://railscasts.com/episodes/196-nested-model-form-revised?view=comments)
* A little bit of help from [this post](https://www.amooma.de/screencasts/2015-01-22-nested_forms-rails-4.2/)
* This [gem](https://github.com/ncri/nested_form_fields) didn't work, but it helped me understand what was going on

`rails s` - start server
